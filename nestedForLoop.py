We have provided the list sales_data that shows the numbers of different flavors of ice cream sold at three different locations of the fictional shop, Gilbert and Ilbertâ€™s Scoop Shop. We want to sum up the total number of scoops sold. Start by defining a variable scoops_sold and set it to zero.

Go through the sales_data list. Call each inner list location, and print out each location list.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
